In this program, an artificial intelligence learns how to become the ultimate king of pong. This is because of an algorithm I implemented called Neuro Evolution of Augmented Technologies (NEAT). 

NEAT is a method developed for evolving arbitrary neural networks. In this program, we can see the implementation of it as the pong AI gets better and does not let the ball pass after multiple generations. 

Requirements: 
NEAT-Python
PyGame

To run, compile and run tutorials.py
